# Robotic Aid for Sign Language Translation

## Overview
This project aims to create a robotic system that facilitates communication for individuals with hearing and speaking disabilities. With an estimated 1.8 to 7 million people in India facing these challenges and only 250 certified sign language translators available, our solution addresses the critical need for effective communication tools.

## Objectives
- Develop a robotic hand that translates spoken language into sign language gestures.
- Create a system that converts sign language gestures into spoken language.
- Utilize inexpensive microcontrollers to ensure scalability and accessibility.
- Implement a TensorFlow Lite model for sign language recognition.

## Features
- **Speech to Sign Language Translation**: Converts normal speech into corresponding sign language gestures using a robotic hand.
- **Sign Language to Speech Translation**: Recognizes sign language gestures and translates them into human speech.
- **WiFi Enabled**: The system is designed to operate with WiFi connectivity for enhanced functionality.
- **Scalable Solution**: Built on affordable hardware to promote widespread adoption.

## Challenges Addressed
- Shortage of certified sign language interpreters and educators.
- Limitations of smartphone-based solutions, such as screen size and accuracy.
- Variability in sign languages across different regions.
